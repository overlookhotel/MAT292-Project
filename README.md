# MAT292 Project - Modelling the spread of COVID-19
This project was coded on MATLAB. The purpose of this project is to code and then evaluate the ability of the SIRU and SEIQR models to predict the behaviour of the pandemic in the US. The insights gained from this analysis is used to then inform the creation of our own model, would better account for government interventions through social isolation and vaccinations to better predict the pandemic's behaviour.
